# Cross-compilation

Crystal supports a basic form of [cross compilation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_compiler).

In order to achieve this, the compiler executable provides two flags:

* `--cross-compile`: When given enables cross compilation mode
* `--target`: the [LLVM Target Triple](http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#target-triple) to use and set the default [compile-time flags](compile_time_flags.html) from

To get the `--target` flags you can execute `llvm-config --host-target` using an installed LLVM 3.5. For example on a Linux it could say "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu".

If you need to set any compile-time flags not set implicitly through `--target`, you can use the `-D` command line flag.

Using these two, we can compile a program in a Mac that will run on that Linux like this:

```bash
crystal build your_program.cr --cross-compile --target "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu"
```

This will generate a `.o` ([Object file](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_file)) and will print a line with a command to execute on the system we are trying to cross-compile to. For example:

```bash
cc your_program.o -o your_program -lpcre -lrt -lm -lgc -lunwind
```

You must copy this `.o` file to that system and execute those commands. Once you do this the executable will be available in that target system.

This procedure is usually done with the compiler itself to port it to new platforms where a compiler is not yet available. Because in order to compile a Crystal compiler we need an older Crystal compiler, the only two ways to generate a compiler for a system where there isn't a compiler yet are:
* We checkout the latest version of the compiler written in Ruby, and from that compiler we compile the next versions until the current one.
* We create a `.o` file in the target system and from that file we create a compiler.

The first alternative is long and cumbersome, while the second one is much easier.

Cross-compiling can be done for other executables, but its main target is the compiler. If Crystal isn't available in some system you can try cross-compiling it there.

## Example of cross-compiling

Here's an example of how to cross compile a crystal app on a host machine and then transfering it to the target machine (in this case an Ubuntu aarch64/arm64) and compiles the last bits there:

```bash
#!/bin/bash -eu

srcfile=$1
target=$2

export CFLAGS="-fPIC"
buildcmd=$(crystal build --cross-compile --target=aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu --release $srcfile)

# Upload the object file to the aarch64 machine
scp "$(basename $srcfile).o" "$target":.
rm "$(basename $srcfile).o"

# SSH to the target machine
ssh "$target" << EOF
# install dependencies
sudo apt-get install -y clang libssl-dev libpcre3-dev libgc-dev libevent-dev zlib1g-dev

# download and compile crystal's sigfault library
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crystal-lang/crystal/master/src/ext/sigfault.c
cc -c -o sigfault.o sigfault.c
ar -rcs libcrystal.a sigfault.o
sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/crystal/src/ext
sudo cp libcrystal.a /usr/share/crystal/src/ext/

# compile the object file with the command crystal build --cross-compile gave us
$buildcmd
EOF
```
